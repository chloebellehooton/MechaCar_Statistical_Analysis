## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
DELIVERABLE 1

Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes

In your README, create a subheading, ## Linear Regression to Predict MPG, and write a short summary using a screenshot of the output from the linear regression, and address the following questions:

- Vehicle weight, spoiler angle, and AWD all are predictors of MPG due to their p-values being above 0.05
-

Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
